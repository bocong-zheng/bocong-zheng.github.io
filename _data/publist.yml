  abstract: "We demonstrate the formation and transition behaviors of a microplasma around microstructure arrays at different gas pressures via two-dimensional particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision (2d3v) simulations.
    It is found that the microdischarge occurs outside the cathode microcavities at the lowest pressure while starts penetrating the microcavities with a curved sheath edge as the pressure increases.
    At high pressure, microhollow cathode discharges (MHCDs) are formed inside the microcavities and operate in parallel.
    Further increasing the gas pressure results in the disappearance of the MHCDs, and the dominant discharge shifts outside of the microcavity, locating above the microstructure tips.
    The effect of the electric shielding on the discharge and the condition for the MHCD formation are discussed.
    The macroscopic discharge parameters scaling with the gas pressure and the electron kinetics are also examined.
    The results are beneficial for the scaling, design, and optimization of microplasma array devices across a wide range of pressure regimes in practical applications."

  abstract: "We demonstrate the transition characteristics in microhollow cathode discharges (MHCD) at different gas pressures by using two-dimension particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision (2d3v) simulations.
    We found that the discharge is inside the hollow activity at low pressure while mainly locates between the anode and the cathode rectangular protrusion tip at high pressure.
    The spatial distributions of the typical discharge parameters (e.g., electric potential and electron density) are presented.
    The fundamental electron kinetics (e.g., electron power absorption) are examined based on the momentum analysis of the electron Boltzmann equation.
    The results provide fundamental insights into MHCD at varying pressure conditions, which could be further beneficial for the design and fabrication of microplasma devices in practical applications."

  abstract: "We demonstrate a self-consistent and complete description of electron dynamics in a typical electropositive radio frequency magnetron sputtering (RFMS) argon discharge.
    The electron dynamics, including the electron power absorption dynamics in one radio frequency (RF) period, is studied via a fully kinetic 2d3v particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision (PIC/MCC) electrostatic simulation.
    The interplay between the fundamental plasma parameters is analyzed through their spatiotemporal dynamics.
    The E times B drift-to-discharge current ratio is in approximate agreement with Bohm diffusion.
    The electron power absorption can be primarily decoupled into the positive Ohmic power absorption in the bulk plasma region and the negative pressure-induced power absorption near the target surface.
    Ohmic power absorption is the dominant electron power absorption mechanism, mostly contributed by the azimuthal electron current.
    The power absorption due to electron inertial effects is negligible on time-average.
    Both the maximum power absorption and dissipation of electrons appear in the bulk plasma region during the second half of the RF period, implying that the nonlocal dynamics of electrons is suppressed in magnetron discharges.
    The contribution of secondary electrons is negligible under typical RFMS discharge conditions."

  abstract: "One-dimensional (1d3v) and two-dimensional (2d3v) particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision (PIC/MCC) simulations are performed for a balanced direct current magnetron sputtering (DCMS) discharge.
    The plasma parameters obtained by both simulations above the target racetrack share similar features and magnitudes under similar discharge intensities, i.e., similar local discharge current densities.
    The commonly observed high-energy tail of electron energy distribution in DCMS discharges are reproduced in both simulations.
    The accuracy and applicability of using one-dimensional simulations to qualitatively investigate the characteristics of balanced DCMS discharge are confirmed.
    In terms of capturing the key physical mechanisms in DCMS, one-dimensional PIC simulation is an efficient method, which could largely alleviate the computational expense and preserve the physical fidelity of modeling results."

  abstract: "We verify the similarity law (SL) and show a violation of frequency scaling (f-scaling) in low-pressure capacitive radio frequency (rf) plasmas via fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations.
    The SL scaling relations for electron density and electron power absorption are first confirmed in similar rf discharges.
    Based on these results, with only the driving frequency varied, the f-scaling for electron density is also validated,showing almost the same trend as the SL scaling, across most of the frequency regime.
    However, violations of the f-scaling are observed at lower frequencies, which are found to be relevant to the electron heating mode transition from stochastic to Ohmic heating.
    Electron kinetic invariance is illustrated for the SL and f-scaling being valid, respectively, whereas the electron kinetic variation is observed when the f-scaling is violated."

  abstract: "Similarity transformations are essential for correlating discharges at different scales, which are mostly utilized with local field or local energy approximations.
    In this work, we report the fully kinetic results from particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision simulations that unambiguously demonstrate the similarity of radio frequency (rf) discharges in nonlocal regimes where the electron energy relaxation length is much larger than the gap dimension.
    It is found that at a constant rf voltage amplitude, discharges will be similar if the gas pressure, inverse of gap distance, and rf driving frequency are all changed by the same scaling factor.
    The scaling relations of fundamental parameters are illustrated for rf discharges in the alpha-mode with secondary electron emission ignored, and the temporal electron kinetics are shown to have invariance in similar discharges.
    The results explicitly validate the scaling laws in nonlocal kinetic regimes, indicating promising application potentials of the similarity transformations across a wide range of kinetic regimes."

  abstract: "This work demonstrates the presence of a small number of high-energy ballistic electrons (HEBEs) that originate from secondary electrons in low-pressure radio-frequency (rf) plasmas.
    The kinetic behaviors of the HEBEs are illustrated through electron energy probability functions from the fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, showing two wavy high-energy tails and two bifurcations during one rf cycle.
    Test-particle simulations and a semi-analytical method associated with nonlocal electron kinetics are performed to characterize the HEBE trajectories, which reveal the ballistic nature of the HEBEs and their typical bouncing features between the rf sheaths.
    Parameter dependence of the HEBEs on the discharge conditions (e.g., gas pressure, gap distance, and rf frequency) are identified, which is relevant to the plasma collisionality.
    With a pronounced presence of HEBEs, the overall impacts of the secondary electron emission on discharge parameters, such as electron power absorption and ionization rate, are also illustrated."

  abstract: "One-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations with Monte Carlo collisions are used to investigate the influence of metastable atoms in low pressure radio-frequency argon discharges with magnetic fields ranging from 0 G to 60 G.
    Two metastable levels of argon species are included and tracked as particles, enabling multistep ionization and metastable pooling.
    At low magnetic fields, the metastable argon atoms have little influence on the discharge.
    At higher magnetic fields, the electron density increases and the electron temperature decreases at the center of the discharge with the inclusion of metastable atoms.
    The reduction in electron temperature is attributed to the depletion of energetic electrons due to low-energy-threshold reactions related to the metastable atoms.
    The reduced electron temperature leads to a reduction in the total ionization rate, albeit the contribution of multistep ionization increases with the magnetic field.
    The suppression of plasma diffusion at low electron temperatures plays a greater role than the reduction in ionization rate, resulting in a higher electron density.
    A transformation in metastable density profiles from parabolic to saddle type is observed with the increase in the magnetic field.
    Metastable atoms may play an important role in modulating the electron temperature in low pressure magnetized discharges."

  abstract: "Systematic analysis of discharge processes is needed for a good understanding of the physical mechanism that enables optimal coating deposition, especially pulsed discharges sustained by high voltages and large currents.
    Owing to the temporal and complex characteristics of the discharge process and relatively simplistic analytical methods, the discharge process and particle evolution in high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) are still not well understood.
    In this work, a cylindrical cathode is introduced to restrict the discharge and delay plasma loss, and a global model is established to simulate the discharge on a Cr target in N2/Ar.
    Particles with different reaction energies appearing successively produce an asynchronous discharge phenomenon, and a series of inflection points corresponding to different physical processes including excitation, sputtering, ionization, and diffusion are observed from the particle density evolution curves.
    High-precision and time-resolved spectrometry (400 ns) is utilized to monitor the evolution of particles with time, and inflection points predicted by the model are observed experimentally to verify the particle behavior in the HiPIMS discharge."
